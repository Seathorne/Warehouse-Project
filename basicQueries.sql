/* RETRIEVING DATA PRACTICE ******
 * Retrieving single/multiple columns
 * Retrieving all columns
 * Retrieving distinct rows
 * Retrieving with limited access
 */
-- Select all:
SELECT * FROM gen1Pokemon;

-- Select all distinct types:
SELECT DISTINCT Type FROM gen1Pokemon;

-- Select at most 5 rows:
SELECT * FROM gen1Pokemon
LIMIT 5;

-- Starting at 10, select at most 5 rows:
SELECT * FROM gen1Pokemon
LIMIT 10, 5;

-- Select is cut off at end of table
SELECT * FROM gen1Pokemon
LIMIT 15, 5;

-- Alternate syntax for limiting:
SELECT 5 FROM gen1Pokemon;

-- Syntax where limiting not supported:
WITH ordered AS
(
 SELECT *, row_number() OVER (ORDER BY Number) as row_num
 FROM gen1Pokemon
)
SELECT * FROM ordered WHERE row_num >= 15;

/* SORTING DATA PRACTICE:;
 * Sort by single column
 * Sort by multiple columns
 * Sort by column position
 * Specify sort direction
 */

 -- Order by column value:
 SELECT Name
 FROM gen1Pokemon
 ORDER BY Name;

-- Order by several column values:
SELECT Name,Type
FROM gen1Pokemon
ORDER BY Type,Name; -- orders by type last (highest level)

SELECT Name,Type,Height,Weight
FROM gen1Pokemon
ORDER BY 4,3,2,1; -- overall sorted by weight (name etc. within)

SELECT Name,Type,Height,Weight
FROM gen1Pokemon
ORDER BY 4 DESC,3,2,1; -- order by reverse weight

/* FILTERING DATA PRACTICE: --
 * Checking for matches
 * Checking for nonmatches
 * Checking for a range of values
 * Checking for no value
 * Using the AND operator
 * Using the OR operator
 * Using AND and OR operator
 * Using the IN operator
 * Using the NOT operator
 * Using the LIKE operator
 * The WHERE clause operator

-- Filter by only grass-type Pok√©mon
SELECT Name, Number, Type
FROM gen1Pokemon
WHERE Type = 'Grass'
ORDER BY 2,1;

-- Filter by cards not matching Fire
SELECT Name, Number, Type
FROM gen1Pokemon
WHERE TYPE <> 'Fire'
ORDER BY Type;

-- check for a range...
SELECT Name, Number
FROM gen1Pokemon
WHERE Number BETWEEN 1 AND 10;

-- check outside a range...
SELECT Name, Number
FROM gen1Pokemon
WHERE Number < 5 OR Number >= 15;

-- Check for null/missing values:
SELECT *
FROM gen1Pokemon;
